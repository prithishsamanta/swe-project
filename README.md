MAKING AN APPLICATION FOR TRANSFERRING CRYPTOCURRENCIES THROUGH SMART CONTRACTS

This project was done by us for our Software Engineering Course. This project was made by following the steps of software development. The main objective of our project is to understand the working of smart contracts in blockchain and where they can be implemented. In our project, we have focused on money transferring and insurance. Over the past few months, we have tried to learn the basics of smart contracts, how to code them and deploy them in an ethereum network. For our project, we have made a basic Application for Transferring Cryptocurrencies through Smart Contracts. This application helps us to transfer Ethereum coins to tokens and vice versa. This is done with the help of tools like MetaMask extension, Ganache, Solidity programming, Truffle, etc. We have also followed a particular paper and some of its reference materials for our project. Our base paper is “Application of Smart Contracts based on Ethereum Blockchain for the Purpose of Insurance Services” which talks about the use of blockchain and cryptocurrency in the insurance sector. The above paper has also used the same tools and ERC20 token standard for creating and running the smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.
